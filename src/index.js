/*
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Rules when DECLARING a React component ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
  - Name is capitalized
  - Takes an object ("props") as its one argument
  - Must return SOMETHING (null, empty string, elements...)
  - React provides some built-in components that return HTML elements (h1, div, span...)
  - Attribute names with dashes are camelCased (except data- & aria-)
  - The `class` attribute is `className`, `for` attribute is `htmlFor`
  - We can INTERPOLATE ðŸ”¥ js expressions ðŸ”¥ using curly brackets
  - We interpolate attribute values and content
*/

/*
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Rules when USING a React component ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
  - Components are utilized (invoked?) so we may obtain elements
  - Instead of invoking the component with parens, we invoke with < />
  - Instead of passing args with parens, we pass them with attribute-like syntax
  - Don't forget all tags need to close correctly
*/

// we have MANY of these components per app, usually kept in their own module
// components may render other components inside the JSX returned by the function
function App(props) { // one object called "props"
  const { cohort, instructor, happy, week } = props

  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <h1 id="mainHeading">Welcome to React, Web {cohort}</h1>
      <div>{instructor} welcomes you!</div>

      {happy ? <div>Very happy</div> : <div>It is Monday</div>}

      <div>It is week {week}</div>

      <Playground cohort={cohort} />

    </div>
  )
}

// we only do this once per app, normally
render(
  <App cohort='37' instructor='Rhionna' happy={true} week={2} />, // element(s)
  document.querySelector('#root')
)
